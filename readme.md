This is where info on how to use this is gonna go.

I initially made the book entries objects of a class, but due to the objects being created by user input and not assigned a name/variable, I was struggling to access and edit them the way I wanted to. I decided to turn them into dictionaries for easier use and access, but I'd definitely like to keep playing with objects and see what else I can do with them.

I would like to learn how to make data persist using databases.
